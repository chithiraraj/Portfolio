# Business Context:
Accidents occur worldwide due to various factors such as negligent driving, adverse climatic conditions, and infrastructure issues. These incidents lead to a significant number of insurance claims, posing a challenge for insurance companies. Accurately estimating the number of accidents and subsequent claims is crucial for the sustainability and profitability of the business. By analyzing the claims data, insurance companies can anticipate future claims, optimize their financial reserves, and develop innovative policies.

Understanding the patterns and trends in claims data is equally essential. Insights derived from such analysis enable companies to offer tailored insurance policies that provide better benefits to users while optimizing premium rates. This balance ensures customer satisfaction and maximizes the company’s profitability. Additionally, analyzing claims data can help in identifying fraud, improving customer segmentation, and creating dynamic pricing models based on risk profiles.
